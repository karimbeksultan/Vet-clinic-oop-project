# Welcome to my OOP Project in Java

My name is *Karim Beksultan, and I am a first-year student of AITU, group **BDA-2511*.  
This project is an application for a *Veterinary Clinic*, developed using the Java programming language as part of my Object-Oriented Programming coursework.

## How to Run
1. Open the project in any IDE (I used *IntelliJ IDEA*).  
2. Navigate to the *src* folder and run the file *Main.java*.

This project was created to gain experience and expand my knowledge in Java programming.  
Thank you for your attention!
